Hotel Booking Cancellation Analysis :
 This repository contains a Python-based data analysis project focused on understanding and mitigating hotel booking cancellations for City Hotel and Resort Hotel. The goal is to provide insights into factors that drive cancellations and to offer data-driven suggestions to reduce cancellation rates and optimize revenue.

Project Overview :
 In recent years, both City Hotel and Resort Hotel have experienced high cancellation rates, leading to decreased revenue and inefficient use of resources. This project analyzes the data to identify key factors contributing to cancellations and explores potential solutions for these issues.

Business Problem:
 High cancellation rates cause several problems:
 1.Reduced revenue
 2.Underutilized hotel rooms 

Research Questions :
 1.What variables affect hotel reservation cancellations?
 2.How can we reduce hotel reservation cancellations?
 3.How can hotels make better pricing and promotional decisions?

Hypotheses :
 1.More cancellations occur when prices are high.
 2.Longer waiting lists lead to higher cancellation rates.
 3.Most cancellations are from reservations made through offline travel agents.

Dataset:
 The dataset used in this analysis includes booking information for City Hotel and Resort Hotel from 2015 to 2017. Key features include:
 1.Booking dates
 2.Hotel types
 3.Cancellations
 4.Average daily rates
 5.Customer origin

Analysis and Findings :
 1.Cancellation Rate: 37% of bookings are canceled, significantly affecting hotel revenue.
 2.Booking Comparison: City hotels receive more bookings than resort hotels, which may be due to price differences.
 3.Price and Cancellations: Higher prices correlate with higher cancellation rates, particularly in resort hotels.
 4.Country-wise Cancellations: Portugal has the highest number of canceled bookings.
 5.Customer Sources: The majority of bookings come from online travel agencies (46%), followed by group reservations (27%).

Visualizations :
 This project includes several key visualizations to aid in understanding cancellation trends:
 1.Bar charts showing the percentage of cancellations.
 2.Line charts comparing average daily rates between City and Resort hotels.
 3.Grouped bar charts depicting reservation and cancellation trends by month.
 4.Pie charts illustrating the customer booking sources.

Suggestions :
 Based on the analysis, the following recommendations were made:
 1.Adjust pricing strategies, especially for high-demand periods, to reduce cancellation rates.
 2.Offer targeted discounts, particularly for resort hotels during weekends and holidays.
 3.Increase marketing efforts in January, a month with high cancellation rates.
 4.Improve service quality in Portugal, where cancellations are highest.

Conclusion :
 This project provides valuable insights into hotel booking cancellations and offers data-driven recommendations to minimize revenue loss and improve operational efficiency.
